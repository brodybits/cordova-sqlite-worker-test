# Cordova/PhoneGap sqlite storage - free enterprise version with web worker test
 
Test release with *very basic* support web workers in `sample-worker/www` (test in `workertest/www`) for Android and iOS *ONLY*.

Native interface to sqlite in a Cordova/PhoneGap plugin for Android, iOS, and Windows "Universal" (8.1) with API similar to HTML5/[Web SQL API](http://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/).

This version is available under GPL v3 (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.txt) or commercial license. Contact for commercial license: info@litehelpers.net

NOTE (TBD): no Circle CI or Travis CI working in this version branch.

## SECURITY TODO(s)

- XHR URI request mechanism needs a secret code mechanism, like they have in the Cordova framework

## Usage in web worker(s)

It is *highly* recommended to use the sample application in `sample-worker/www` as a starting point, at least during initial testing.

Some **important** pointers:
- See `sample-worker/www/index.html`, the `aqmain.js` script must be included before your app Javascript
- See `sample-worker/www/index.js`: a worker must be registered with a unique name using the `aqregister` function before the worker can have access to the sqlite plugin features
- See `sample-worker/www/sample-worker.js`: some requirements in the worker script:
  - The following scripts must be imported: `aqworker.js` and `Worker-SQLitePlugin.js`
  - To receive messages from the main thread, please use `self.addEventListener` instead of `self.onmessage`
  - This plugin sends internal string messages starting with `!!!` from the main thread to the worker thread. It is *highly* recommended to filter the messages for your own pattern.

## Status

- ~~Free support is available in public locations such as [litehelpers / Cordova-sqlite-enterprise-free / issues](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-enterprise-free/issues) and https://gitter.im/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage;~~ commercial support is available by contacting: info@litehelpers.net
- Patches patches will *NOT* be accepted on this project due to potential licensing issues.
- Features omitted from this version branch: pre-populated database support, REGEXP extension for iOS, WP(7/8) and Amazon Fire-OS support
- Windows "Universal" (8.1) version is in an experimental/pre-alpha state:
  - Database close and delete operations not yet implemented
  - No background processing (for future consideration)
  - You *may* encounter issues with Cordova CLI due to [CB-8866](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-8866); as a workaround you can install using [litehelpers / cordova-windows-nufix](https://github.com/litehelpers/cordova-windows-nufix) and `plugman` as described below.
  - In addition, problems with the Windows "Universal" version have been reported in case of a Cordova project using a Visual Studio template/extension instead of Cordova/PhoneGap CLI or `plugman`
  - Not tested with a Windows 10 (or Windows Phone 10) target; Windows 10 build is not expected to work with Windows Phone
- FTS3, FTS4, and R-Tree support is tested working OK in this version (for target platforms Android/iOS/Windows "Universal")
- Status for the other target platforms:
  - Android: now using [Android-sqlite-connector](https://github.com/liteglue/Android-sqlite-connector) (with sqlite `3.7.17`), with support for FTS3/FTS4 and R-Tree
  - iOS: sqlite `3.8.10.2` embedded
- Android is supported back to SDK 10 (a.k.a. Gingerbread, Android 2.3.3); support for older versions is available upon request.
- FTS3, FTS4, and R-Tree support is tested working OK in this version (for all target platforms Android/iOS/Windows "Universal")
- API to open the database may be changed somewhat to be more streamlined. Transaction and single-statement query API will NOT be changed.
 
## Announcements

- This version has the following API improvement(s):
  - Multi-part transactions API (described below)
  - Error result with proper Web SQL `code` member and `sqliteCode` as reported by the SQLite C library (Android/iOS)
- This version has the following memory improvements:
  - flat JSON interface between Javascript and native parts
  - *optional*: transaction sql chunking, which can be enabled by changing the `MAX_SQL_CHUNK` value in SQLitePlugin.js
- Android version is now using the lightweight [Android-sqlite-connector](https://github.com/liteglue/Android-sqlite-connector)
- Windows "Universal" version now supports both Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1
- iOS version is now fixed to override the correct pluginInitialize method and should work with recent versions of iOS
- Project has been renamed to prevent confusion with [davibe / Phonegap-SQLitePlugin](https://github.com/davibe/Phonegap-SQLitePlugin) (original version for iOS, with a different API)
- New project location (should redirect)
- The test suite is completely ported to Jasmine (2.2.0) and was used to verify the functionality of the new Windows version
- [SQLCipher](https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/) for Windows (8.1) in addition to Android & iOS is now supported by [litehelpers / Cordova-sqlcipher-adapter](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlcipher-adapter)
- New `openDatabase` and `deleteDatabase` `location` option to select database location (iOS *only*) and disable iCloud backup
- Fixes to work with PouchDB by [@nolanlawson](https://github.com/nolanlawson)

## Highlights

- Drop-in replacement for HTML5 SQL API, the only change should be `window.openDatabase()` --> `sqlitePlugin.openDatabase()`
- Failure-safe nested transactions with batch processing optimizations
- As described in [this posting](http://brodyspark.blogspot.com/2012/12/cordovaphonegap-sqlite-plugins-offer.html):
  - Keeps sqlite database in a user data location that is known; can be reconfigured (iOS version); and synchronized to iCloud by default (iOS version; can be disabled as described below).
  - No 5MB maximum, more information at: http://www.sqlite.org/limits.html

## Some apps using this plugin

- REDCap Mobile App (part of [Project REDCap Software](http://projectredcap.org/software.php) for data collection)

## Known issues

- Multi-page apps are not supported and _may_ be broken on Android
- Using web workers is currently not supported and known to be broken on Android
- On Windows "Universal" (8.1), rowsAffected can be wrong when there are multiple levels of nesting of INSERT statements.
- A stability issue was reported on the iOS version when in use together with [SockJS](http://sockjs.org/) client such as [pusher-js](https://github.com/pusher/pusher-js) at the same time. The workaround is to call sqlite functions and [SockJS](http://sockjs.org/) client functions in separate ticks (using setTimeout with 0 timeout).
- If a sql statement fails for which there is no error handler or the error handler does not return `false` to signal transaction recovery, the plugin fires the remaining sql callbacks before aborting the transaction.

## Other limitations

- The db version, display name, and size parameter values are not supported and will be ignored.
- This plugin will not work before the callback for the "deviceready" event has been fired, as described in **Usage**. (This is consistent with the other Cordova plugins.)
- The Android versions cannot work with more than 100 open db files (due to the threading model used).
- UNICODE line separator (`\u2028`) is currently not supported and known to be broken in iOS version.
- Blob type is currently not supported and known to be broken on multiple platforms.
- UNICODE `\u0000` (same as `\0`) character not working in Android or Windows/Windows Phone (8.1)
- Case-insensitive matching and other string manipulations on Unicode characters, which is provided by optional ICU integration in the sqlite source and working with recent versions of Android, is not supported for any target platforms.
- iOS version uses a thread pool but with only one thread working at a time due to "synchronized" database access
- Large query result can be slow, also due to JSON implementation
- ATTACH another database file is not supported (due to path specifications, which work differently depending on the target platform)
- User-defined savepoints are not supported and not expected to be compatible with the transaction locking mechanism used by this plugin. In addition, the use of BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK statements is not supported.

## Limited support (testing needed)

- UNICODE paragraph separator (`\u2029`)
- Triggers have only been tested on iOS
- UNICODE characters not fully tested in the Windows "Universal" (8.1) version
- JOIN needs to be tested more.

- [MSOpenTech / cordova-plugin-websql](https://github.com/MSOpenTech/cordova-plugin-websql) - Windows 8(+) and Windows Phone 8(+) WebSQL plugin versions in C#
- [MetaMemoryT / websql-client](https://github.com/MetaMemoryT/websql-client) - provides the same API and connects to [websql-server](https://github.com/MetaMemoryT/websql-server) through WebSockets.

# Usage

The idea is to emulate the HTML5/[Web SQL API](http://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/) as closely as possible. The only major change is to use `window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase()` (or `sqlitePlugin.openDatabase()`) instead of `window.openDatabase()`. If you see any other major change please report it, it is probably a bug.

**NOTE:** If a sqlite statement in a transaction fails with an error, the error handler *must* return `false` in order to recover the transaction. This is correct according to the HTML5/[Web SQL API](http://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/) standard. This is different from the WebKit implementation of Web SQL in Android and iOS which recovers the transaction if a sql error hander returns a non-`true` value.

## Opening a database

There are two options to open a database:
- Recommended: `var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: "my.db", location: 1});`
- Classical: `var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase("myDatabase.db", "1.0", "Demo", -1);`

The new `location` option is used to select the database subdirectory location (iOS *only*) with the following choices:
- `0` (default): `Documents` - visible to iTunes and backed up by iCloud
- `1`: `Library` - backed up by iCloud, *NOT* visible to iTunes
- `2`: `Library/LocalDatabase` - *NOT* visible to iTunes and *NOT* backed up by iCloud

**IMPORTANT:** Please wait for the "deviceready" event, as in the following example:

```js
// Wait for Cordova to load
document.addEventListener("deviceready", onDeviceReady, false);

// Cordova is ready
function onDeviceReady() {
  var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: "my.db"});
  // ...
}
```

**NOTE:** The database file name should include the extension, if desired.

## SQL transactions

The following types of SQL transactions are supported by this version:
- Single-statement transactions
- Standard asynchronous transactions
- Multi-part transactions

### Single-statement transactions

Sample:

```Javascript
db.executeSql("select length('tenletters') as stringlength", [], function (res) {
  var stringlength = res.rows.item(0).stringlength;
  console.log('got stringlength: ' + stringlength);
});
```

### Multi-part transactions

Sample:

```Javascript
var tx = db.beginTransaction();
tx.executeSql("DROP TABLE IF EXISTS mytable");
tx.executeSql("CREATE TABLE mytable (myfield)");

tx.executeSql("INSERT INTO mytable values(?)", ['test value']);
tx.executeSql("SELECT * from mytable", [], function(tx, res) {
  console.log("Got value: " + res.rows.item(0).myfield);
}, function(e) {
  console.log("Ignore unexpected error callback with message: " + e.message);
  return false;
});

tx.end(function() {
  console.log('Optional success callback');
}, function(e) {
  console.log("Optional error callback with message: " + e.message);
});
```

Sample with abort:

```Javascript
var tx = db.beginTransaction();
tx.executeSql("INSERT INTO mytable values(?)", ['wrong data']);
tx.abort(function() {
  console.log('Optional callback');
});
```

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- In case a `tx.executeSql` call results in an error and it does not have an error callback or the error callback does NOT return `false`, the transaction will be aborted with a ROLLBACK upon the `tx.end` call.
- When a multi-part transaction is started by the `db.beginTransaction` call, all other transactions are blocked until the multi-part transaction is either completed successfully or aborted (with a ROLLBACK).

## Background processing

The threading model depends on which version is used:
- For Android, one background thread per db;
- for iOS, background processing using a very limited thread pool (only one thread working at a time);
- for Windows "Universal" (8.1), no background processing (for future consideration).

# Sample with PRAGMA feature

This is a pretty strong test: first we create a table and add a single entry, then query the count to check if the item was inserted as expected. Note that a new transaction is created in the middle of the first callback.

```js
// Wait for Cordova to load
document.addEventListener("deviceready", onDeviceReady, false);

// Cordova is ready
function onDeviceReady() {
  var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: "my.db"});

  db.transaction(function(tx) {
    tx.executeSql('DROP TABLE IF EXISTS test_table');
    tx.executeSql('CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS test_table (id integer primary key, data text, data_num integer)');

    // demonstrate PRAGMA:
    db.executeSql("pragma table_info (test_table);", [], function(res) {
      console.log("PRAGMA res: " + JSON.stringify(res));
    });

    tx.executeSql("INSERT INTO test_table (data, data_num) VALUES (?,?)", ["test", 100], function(tx, res) {
      console.log("insertId: " + res.insertId + " -- probably 1");
      console.log("rowsAffected: " + res.rowsAffected + " -- should be 1");

      db.transaction(function(tx) {
        tx.executeSql("select count(id) as cnt from test_table;", [], function(tx, res) {
          console.log("res.rows.length: " + res.rows.length + " -- should be 1");
          console.log("res.rows.item(0).cnt: " + res.rows.item(0).cnt + " -- should be 1");
        });
      });

    }, function(e) {
      console.log("ERROR: " + e.message);
    });
  });
}
```

**NOTE:** PRAGMA statements must be executed in `executeSql()` on the database object (i.e. `db.executeSql()`) and NOT within a transaction.

## Sample with transaction-level nesting

In this case, the same transaction in the first executeSql() callback is being reused to run executeSql() again.

```js
// Wait for Cordova to load
document.addEventListener("deviceready", onDeviceReady, false);

// Cordova is ready
function onDeviceReady() {
  var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase("Database", "1.0", "Demo", -1);

  db.transaction(function(tx) {
    tx.executeSql('DROP TABLE IF EXISTS test_table');
    tx.executeSql('CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS test_table (id integer primary key, data text, data_num integer)');

    tx.executeSql("INSERT INTO test_table (data, data_num) VALUES (?,?)", ["test", 100], function(tx, res) {
      console.log("insertId: " + res.insertId + " -- probably 1");
      console.log("rowsAffected: " + res.rowsAffected + " -- should be 1");

      tx.executeSql("select count(id) as cnt from test_table;", [], function(tx, res) {
        console.log("res.rows.length: " + res.rows.length + " -- should be 1");
        console.log("res.rows.item(0).cnt: " + res.rows.item(0).cnt + " -- should be 1");
      });

    }, function(e) {
      console.log("ERROR: " + e.message);
    });
  });
}
```

This case will also works with Safari (WebKit), assuming you replace `window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase` with `window.openDatabase`.

## Delete a database

```js
window.sqlitePlugin.deleteDatabase({name: "my.db", location: 1}, successcb, errorcb);
```

`location` as described above for `openDatabase` (iOS *only*)

**NOTE:** not implemented for Windows "Universal" (8.1) version.

# Installing

## Windows "Universal" target platform

**PREREQUISITE** in this version branch *ONLY*: install recent version of `sqlite3.[hc]` in `src/external` and make sure the following constants are defined: `#define SQLITE_TEMP_STORE 2` `#define SQLITE_THREADSAFE 2` and for Windows Phone 8.1 *only*: `#define SQLITE_WIN32_FILEMAPPING_API 1`

**IMPORTANT:** There are issues supporing certain Windows target platforms due to [CB-8866](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-8866):
- When using Visual Studio, the default target ("Mixed Platforms") will not work
- Problems have been with the Windows "Universal" version case of a Cordova project using a Visual Studio template/extension instead of Cordova/PhoneGap CLI or `plugman`
As an alternative, which will support the ("Mixed Platforms") target, you can use `plugman` instead with [litehelpers / cordova-windows-nufix](https://github.com/litehelpers/cordova-windows-nufix), as described here.

### Using plugman to support "Mixed Platforms"

- make sure you have the latest version of `plugman` installed: `npm install -g plugman`
- Download the [cordova-windows-nufix 3.9.0-nufixpre-01 zipball](https://github.com/litehelpers/cordova-windows-nufix/archive/3.9.0-nufixpre-01.zip) (or you can clone [litehelpers / cordova-windows-nufix](https://github.com/litehelpers/cordova-windows-nufix) instead)
- Create your Windows "Universal" (8.1) project using [litehelpers / cordova-windows-nufix](https://github.com/litehelpers/cordova-windows-nufix):
  - `path.to.cordova-windows-nufix/bin/create.bat your_app_path your.app.id YourAppName`
- `cd your_app_path` and install plugin using `plugman`:
  - `plugman install --platform windows --project . --plugin https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-enterprise-free`
- Put your sql program in your project `www` (don't forget to reference it from `www\index.html` and wait for `deviceready` event)

Then your project in `CordovaApp.sln` should work with "Mixed Platforms" on both Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1.

## Easy install with Cordova CLI tool

    npm install -g cordova # if you don't have cordova
    cordova create MyProjectFolder com.my.project MyProject && cd MyProjectFolder # if you are just starting
    cordova plugin add https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-enterprise-free
 
You can find more details at [this writeup](http://iphonedevlog.wordpress.com/2014/04/07/installing-chris-brodys-sqlite-database-with-cordova-cli-android/).

**WARNING:** for Windows target platform please read the section below.

**IMPORTANT:** sometimes you have to update the version for a platform before you can build, like: `cordova prepare ios`

**NOTE:** If you cannot build for a platform after `cordova prepare`, you may have to remove the platform and add it again, such as:

    cordova platform rm ios
    cordova platform add ios

## Easy install with plugman tool

```shell
plugman install --platform MYPLATFORM --project path.to.my.project.folder --plugin https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-enterprise-free
```

where MYPLATFORM is `android`, `ios`, or `windows`.

A posting how to get started developing on Windows host without the Cordova CLI tool (for Android target only) is available [here](http://brodybits.blogspot.com/2015/03/trying-cordova-for-android-on-windows-without-cordova-cli.html).

## Source tree

- `SQLitePlugin.coffee.md`: platform-independent (Literate coffee-script, can be read by recent coffee-script compiler)
- `www`: `SQLitePlugin.js` platform-independent Javascript as generated from `SQLitePlugin.coffee.md` (and checked in!)
- `src`: platform-specific source code:
   - `external` - placeholder used to import `sqlite-connector.jar`, `sqlite-native-driver.jar` (needed for Android version), and `sqlite3.[hc]` (needed to build Windows "Universal" (8.1) version) in this version branch
   - `android` - Java plugin code for Android
   - `ios` - Objective-C plugin code for iOS;
   - `windows` - Javascript proxy code and SQLite3-WinRT project for Windows "Universal" (8.1);
- `spec`: test suite using Jasmine (2.2.0), ported from QUnit `test-www` test suite, working on all platforms
- `tests`: very simple Jasmine test suite that is run on Circle CI (Android version) and Travis CI (iOS version)
- `Lawnchair-adapter`: Lawnchair adaptor, based on the version from the Lawnchair repository, with the basic Lawnchair test suite in `test-www` subdirectory

## Manual installation - Android version

These installation instructions are based on the Android example project from Cordova/PhoneGap 2.7.0, using the `lib/android/example` subdirectory from the PhoneGap 2.7 zipball.

 - Install `SQLitePlugin.js` from `www` into `assets/www`
 - Install `SQLitePlugin.java` from `src/android/io/liteglue` into `src/io/liteglue` subdirectory
 - Install the `libs` subtree from `common` with `sqlite-connector.jar` and `sqlite-native-driver.jar` into your Android project
 - Add the plugin element `<plugin name="SQLitePlugin" value="io.liteglue.SQLitePlugin"/>` to `res/xml/config.xml`

Sample change to `res/xml/config.xml` for Cordova/PhoneGap 2.x:

```

Before building for the first time, you have to update the project with the desired version of the Android SDK with a command like:

    android update project --path $(pwd) --target android-19

(assuming Android SDK 19, use the correct desired Android SDK number here)

**NOTE:** using this plugin on Cordova pre-3.0 requires the following changes to `SQLitePlugin.java`:

## Manual installation - iOS version

### SQLite library

In the Project "Build Phases" tab, select the _first_ "Link Binary with Libraries" dropdown menu and add the library `libsqlite3.dylib` or `libsqlite3.0.dylib`.

**NOTE:** In the "Build Phases" there can be multiple "Link Binary with Libraries" dropdown menus. Please select the first one otherwise it will not work.

### SQLite Plugin

- Copy `SQLitePlugin.[hm]` from `src/ios` into your project Plugins folder and add them in XCode (I always just have "Create references" as the option selected).
- Copy `SQLitePlugin.js` from `www` into your project `www` folder
- Enable the SQLitePlugin in `config.xml`

Sample change to `config.xml` for Cordova/PhoneGap 2.x:

## Manual installation - Windows "Universal" (8.1) version

Described above.

## Quick installation test

Assuming your app has a recent template as used by the Cordova create script, add the following code to the `onDeviceReady` function, after `app.receivedEvent('deviceready');`:

```Javascript
  window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({ name: 'hello-world.db' }, function (db) {
    db.executeSql("select length('tenletters') as stringlength", [], function (res) {
      var stringlength = res.rows.item(0).stringlength;
      console.log('got stringlength: ' + stringlength);
      document.getElementById('deviceready').querySelector('.received').innerHTML = 'stringlength: ' + stringlength;
   });
  });
```

# Common traps & pitfalls

- The plugin class name starts with "SQL" in capital letters, but in Javascript the `sqlitePlugin` object name starts with "sql" in small letters.
- Attempting to open a database before receiving the "deviceready" event callback.

# Support

## Reporting issues

If you have an issue with the plugin please check the following first:
- You are using the latest version of the Plugin Javascript & platform-specific Java or Objective-C source from this repository.
- You have installed the Javascript & platform-specific Java or Objective-C correctly.
- You have included the correct version of the cordova Javascript and SQLitePlugin.js and got the path right.
- You have registered the plugin properly in `config.xml`.

If you still cannot get something to work, please create a fresh, clean Cordova project, add this plugin according to the instructions above, and try a simple test program.

If you continue to see the issue in a fresh, clean Cordova project:
- Make the simplest test program you can to demonstrate the issue, including the following characteristics:
  - it completely self-contained, i.e. it is using no extra libraries beyond cordova & SQLitePlugin.js;
  - if the issue is with *adding* data to a table, that the test program includes the statements you used to open the database and create the table;
  - if the issue is with *retrieving* data from a table, that the test program includes the statements you used to open the database, create the table, and enter the data you are trying to retrieve.

Then you can [raise the new issue](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-enterprise-free/issues/new).

# Unit tests

Unit testing is done in `spec`.

## running tests from shell

To run the tests from \*nix shell, simply do either:
 
    ./bin/test.sh ios

or for Android:

    ./bin/test.sh android

To run then from a windows powershell do either

    .\bin\test.ps1 android

or for Windows (8.1):

    .\bin\test.ps1 windows

# Adapters

## Lawnchair Adapter

### Common adapter

Please look at the `Lawnchair-adapter` tree that contains a common adapter, which should also work with the Android version, along with a test-www directory.

### Included files

Include the following Javascript files in your HTML:

- `cordova.js` (don't forget!)
- `lawnchair.js` (you provide)
- `SQLitePlugin.js` (in case of Cordova pre-3.0)
- `Lawnchair-sqlitePlugin.js` (must come after `SQLitePlugin.js` in case of Cordova pre-3.0)

### Sample

The `name` option determines the sqlite database filename, *with no extension automatically added*. Optionally, you can change the db filename using the `db` option.

In this example, you would be using/creating a database with filename `kvstore`:

```Javascript
kvstore = new Lawnchair({name: "kvstore"}, function() {
  // do stuff
);
```

Using the `db` option you can specify the filename with the desired extension and be able to create multiple stores in the same database file. (There will be one table per store.)

```Javascript
recipes = new Lawnchair({db: "cookbook", name: "recipes", ...}, myCallback());
ingredients = new Lawnchair({db: "cookbook", name: "ingredients", ...}, myCallback());
```

**KNOWN ISSUE:** the new db options are *not* supported by the Lawnchair adapter. The workaround is to first open the database file using `sqlitePlugin.openDatabase()`.

## PouchDB

The adapter is now part of [PouchDB](http://pouchdb.com/) thanks to [@nolanlawson](https://github.com/nolanlawson), see [PouchDB FAQ](http://pouchdb.com/faq.html).

**NOTE:** The PouchDB adapter has not been tested with the Android version which is using the new [Android-sqlite-connector](https://github.com/liteglue/Android-sqlite-connector).
